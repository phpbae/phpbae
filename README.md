### Hi there 👋

> We started developing the web in June 2016.🖥️ <br>
> After leaving the company, I am currently looking for a job and studying react.js and front-end technology.📚

--- 

> This git repository is being used to manage technologies related to the back-end.(java,spring framework,etc)🏆 <br>
> We don't care much about this repository right now. Because I'm learning the front-end technologies.
